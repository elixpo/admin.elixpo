## About

Elixpo is a family of apps that all share one account — your blog, your canvas,
your short links, your payments, and more. **Elixpo Admin is mission control:**
the single window the team uses to keep every one of those services fast,
healthy, and running, so you never have to think about it.

It auto-discovers every Pages project, Worker, D1, KV, Queue, Durable Object and
Workflow on the Elixpo Cloudflare account, surfaces full Cloudflare
observability, and ships a public status page. It quietly watches the whole
platform and shows, at a glance:

- 🟢 **What's up right now** — a live health check for every product.
- 📈 **How things are doing** — traffic, errors, and usage over time.
- 🌍 **Where people are** — visitors by country on an interactive globe.
- 🗂️ **Everything we run** — every app, database, and service, discovered
  automatically. Nothing is hidden, nothing is hand-maintained.

> This repository is the source for **admin.elixpo.com** — an internal, hosted
> dashboard. It is built with Next.js and runs on Cloudflare.

### The public status page

Anyone can check whether Elixpo is healthy — no login needed:

#### 👉 [admin.elixpo.com/status](https://admin.elixpo.com/status)

It shows a 90-day uptime history for the platform, the current status of each
product, and a feed of recent changes. If something's ever wrong, this is the
place to look.

### Who can get in?

The admin console itself is **invite-only** — only Elixpo team members marked as
admins can sign in (through the same Elixpo account you already use elsewhere).
Everyone else is welcomed at the door and pointed to the public status page or a
quick way to request access.

### Running this locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Architecture

Everything runs on **Cloudflare**. Three shared platform services back the
ecosystem, and products are either **SSO-backed SaaS**, **standalone**, or our
**flagship**:

- **`accounts.elixpo`** - single sign-on / identity
- **`mails.elixpo`** - shared mailing infrastructure
- **`payouts.elixpo`** - shared payments / payouts

SaaS products (Blogs, Art, Chat, Sketch, Search) and the flagship **lixrl.com**
all authenticate through Accounts (SSO) and share the Mail and Payouts infra.
The public, login-free surfaces (**elixpo.com**, **oreo.elixpo**, **me.elixpo**)
are standalone. **admin.elixpo** is the operations dashboard and
**status.elixpo** is monitoring.
